# AZURE-Network-Setup

## **Project Overview**
This project focuses on setting up an **Azure Virtual Machine (VM)** using a free-tier Azure account. The goal is to create a functional cloud-based Windows Server with essential network and storage configurations. All resources are managed under a single **Resource Group**, ensuring proper organization and easy cleanup.
